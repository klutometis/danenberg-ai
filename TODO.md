# TODO

## Site Integration

### Resume Integration
- Bring in resume repo content to consolidate everything in one place
- Decide on integration approach (dedicated page, PDF download, or both)
- Maintain single source of truth for professional information

### Media Archive Setup
- Create `assets/archive/media/` directory structure
- Archive articles as PDFs to prevent link rot:
  - Language Forum: AI philosophical reckoning piece
  - Forbes: Sentient AI article
  - Constellation Research: LLM trends coverage
  - Korean startup article
- Consider creating subtle media/press page (separate from minimal front page)
